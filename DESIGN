A cpio entry basically looks like 
an inode followed by contents of the specified length.
Hereafter I'll use the term /entry header/ to refer
to that inode-like information.

The exact form of the entry header can, unfortunately, vary.
(Such are the woes of an operating system
that had friends who didn't play nicely
[until competition showed up].
[Gee, that seems like a familiar story, doesn't it?])

According to the documentation for cpio(1GNU)
there are the following entry header formats:
• bin,		the obsolete binary format.
• newc,		the new (SVR4) portable format.
• odc,		the old portable (ASCII) format.
• crc,		the new (SVR4) portable format with checksum.
• tar,		the old tar format.
• ustar,	the POSIX.1 tar format.
• hpbin,	the obsolete binary format used by HPUX's cpio.
• hpodc,	the portable format used by HPUX's cpio.

The file cpio.el is the door into the package.
cpio.el controls loading other files as needed and, as of yet,
implements the high-level presentation and user-interface functions.

Believing in portability, the formats newc, odc and crc will be first
to be implemented.
tar and ustar formats are already handled by tar-mode and will not be implemented.
If either HP format is implemented, then hpodc will be implemented first.

For common parsing, interpreting, constructing and modifying functions,
for the different entry header formats (common function, not common implementation)
there will be a common API and implementations done
in each of the separate files cpio-ENTRY-HEADER-FORMAT.el, e.g. cpio-newc.el.

This will thus have lots of different functions for each entry header format,
each function named to identify the header format to which it applies.
In the spirit of lisp, they will be referenced by buffer local variables.

Having done no development whatsoever so far, I'm guessing
that a generic entry header format will be useful,
produced, ideally by a single function,
but, given the variety of formats, cannot be.
There will therefore be a variety of entry-header-parsing functions, e.g.:
    cpio-parse-entry-header-bin
    cpio-parse-entry-header-newc
    cpio-parse-entry-header-odc
    cpio-parse-entry-header-crc
    cpio-parse-entry-header-hpbin
    cpio-parse-entry-header-hpodc
, but the common point for programming that /uses/ those functions would be
to call (funcall cpio-parse-entry-header-func).
Indeed, the common function (to isolate such cruft even further)
might be written so simply:
(defun cpio-parse-entry-header (header-str)
   "Parse the given HEADER-STRing and return a cpio entry header structure."
   (funcall cpio-parse-entry-header-func))

Of course, such simplicity is not entirely possible.
You have to guarantee that cpio-parse-entry-header-func has been
appropriately populated.

Similarly, a number of variables will exist to reflect differences
between the different header formats.

Here are some functions that I know this must deliver:

    • presentation (a là dired)
    • view/edit entry
    • delete entry
    • insert entry (If I recall cpio sorts the entries by name,
		    so this should be unambiguous.)
    • update entry (after editing.)
    • create archive (from a list of files, etc. From dired? From what else?)
    • extract archive (Lots of error handling here.
    • batch mode operation

Here are some that would also be nice:

    • validate archive
    • repair archive

Those then reveal at least some support functions:

    • discern archive type
      * hpbin
      * hpodc
      * DONE newc
      * odc
      * tar
      * ustar
    • parse entry headers
      * hpbin
      * hpodc
      * DONE newc
      * odc
      * tar
      * ustar
    • DONE find entry contents (cpio-contents)
    • write entry headers (+ contents)
      * hpbin
      * hpodc
      * DONE newc
      * odc
      * tar
      * ustar
    • DONE mtime → human date/time conversion (mtime-to-touch-string, cpio-mtime-to-mtime-string)
    • DONE mtime replacement in an entry header structure (cpio-set-mtime)
      Also other entry-related information.
      Attributes:
	  * (cpio-set-entry-size)
	  * (cpio-set-entry-name)
	  * (cpio-set-uid)
	  * (cpio-set-gid)
	  * (cpio-set-mode
      Location information:
	  * cpio-set-header-start
	  * cpio-set-contents-start
    • DONE uid/gid → string (defcustom cpio-try-names)
    • DONE octal mode ↔ drwx (s, S, etc.) mode conversions. (cpio-int-mode-to-mode-string)
    • DONE And its inverse (cpio-mode-string-to-int-mode)
    • dev and rdev handling (No, I have no idea what to do with this right now.)


All of those functions should have generic implementations.
They may have header-type-specific get/put functions,
but the processing itself as above should be generic.

I should read through the info for cpio to see what else might be worthwhile.
I see things among the options to cpio(1GNU) like these
    • swap bytes/half words
    • block size (This will affect padding.)
    • make-directories
    • patterns to define which files to include.
    • link (hard link, common inode number)
    • dereference
    • mod time handling
    • override owner/group 
    • unconditional overwriting
