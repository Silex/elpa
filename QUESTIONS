cpio(1) related questions:
• cpio(1) accepts block size on its command line.
  How should that be handled?
  One obvious choice is via customization,
  but that still feels long term.
  What would be other ways?
• Similarly, what about --swap-bytes and --swap-halfwords?
• How should --link be implemented?
• And --[no-]-absolute-filenames?
  This might be reasonable to customize.
• How about --dereference?
• Does --owner=[USER][:.][GROUP] make sense for anyone besides root?
  Similarly for --no-preserve-owner.
• The extract functions act like --preserve-modification-time is set by default.
  Is that the right thing.
• The function of --unconditional has an implicit implementation in cpio-mode.
  Via cpio-dired cpio-mode tries to act like dired and allow over-writing
  after an affirmative response to a prompt.
  From lisp code, however, it will over-write any files.
  Is that the right way to operate?
• How should I handle (1) contiguous data files, (2) doors (on Solaris)
  and (3) migrated files (Cray)?

Dired related questions:
• I only use Linux and other UNIX flavored operating systems.
  M-x dired-clean-directory "flags numerical backups."
  What do numerical backups look like?
• How should I interpret M-x cpio-dired-find-alternate-entry?
  M-x cpio-dired-flag-backup-entries?
  M-x cpio-dired-hide-all?
  M-x cpio-dired-hide-subdir?
• The following commands prepare things for shell commands.
  How should I interpret them?
  M-x cpio-dired-mark-entries-containing-regexp
• Should renaming marked files unmark them?
  For example, moving them to a directory.
  They currently remain marked.
• How should I handle undo?
  Can you undo an entry's deletion?
  chown, etc.?
