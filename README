BBDB is the Insidious Big Brother Database for GNU Emacs. It
provides an address book for email and snail mail addresses, phone
numbers and the like. It can be linked with various Emacs mail
clients (Message and Mail mode, Rmail, Gnus, MH-E, and VM).
BBDB is fully customizable.

BBDB is avaiable at
http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/bbdb/?root=bbdb
To check it out, use
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/bbdb co bbdb

This revised version of BBDB has been tested only with GNU Emacs 23.
Yet it might be not too difficult to adapt it to other recent
dialects of emacs. It is unlikely, though, that you can get this
code running with something like Emacs 18.

This code is under development.  While it should work reliably,
users of previous versions of BBDB are advised that the format of
the BBDB data file has changed.  Migration to the new format should
happen automatically.  Yet it is recommended to make a copy of the
old data file, in case something unexpected happens or you might want
to go back.

Feedback welcome! --  There is a mailing list for discussion of BBDB:

Usage notes (in particular for people who might have used earlier
versions of BBDB):

I found the usage of the old function bbdb-update-records somewhat
confusing. The redesigned function is hopefully clearer. 

The function bbdb-mua-update-records provides the interface between
MUAs and BBDB. Here MUAs currently include Message and Mail mode,
Rmail, Gnus, MH-E and VM,  The actions of bbdb-mua-update-records are
now controlled by only one arg UPDATE-P. It may take the following
values (arranged here in order of increasingly aggressive behavior
of bbdb-mua-update-records.)

 nil      Do nothing (return nil).
 search   Search for existing records matching ADDRESS.
 query    Search for existing records matching ADDRESS;
          query for creation of a new record if the record does not exist.
 create or t  Search for existing records matching ADDRESS;
          create a new record if it does not yet exist.
 a function   This functions will be called with no arguments.
          It should return one of the above values.

The value of UPDATE-P can be customized by means of the MUA-specific
variables bbdb/MUA-update-records-p. If the value of these variables
is a constant, it becomes the value of UPDATE-P. If its value is a
function FUNC, its return value becomes the value of UPDATE-P.
For example, FUNC may analyze the message headers via
bbdb-select-message (and/or its friends bbdb-accept-message and
bbdb-ignore-message) which is customized via bbdb-accept-message-alist,
bbdb-ignore-message-alist and bbdb-update-records-p. The latter
variable defines the non-nil return value of bbdb-select-message
(e.g., search or t) which then becomes the argument UPDATE-P of
bbdb-mua-update-records. So you might want to put more sophisticated
code into bbdb/MUA-update-records-p according to your needs. See the
default value of bbdb/vm-update-records-p as an example.

The default values of various customizable variables correspond to
their least aggressive values. Change this if you like a more
aggressive behavior of BBDB.

BBDB can also check these actions automatically for each message.
Use bbdb-mua-pop-up-init for this.
