Modus Themes
============

Highly accessible themes for GNU Emacs.  The contrast ratio between
foreground and background values should always be >= 7:1, which
conforms with the WCAG AAA standard.

Modus Operandi: light theme.
Modus Vivendi: dark theme.

I live demo them in my Emacs-related screen casts:
