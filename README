Modus Themes
============

EARLY DAYS!!!

Highly accessible themes for GNU Emacs.  The contrast ratio between
foreground and background values should always be >= 7:1, which
conforms with the WCAG AAA standard.

Modus Vivendi: light theme.
Modus Operandi: dark theme.

TODO
----

* Screenshots.
* Expand face coverage, especially for common Emacs interfaces.
* Implement Lisp functions/variables.
* Continue testing colour combinations.
