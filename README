Eev's central idea is that you can keep "executable logs" of what you
do, in a format that is reasonably readable and that is easy to "play
back" later, step by step and in any order. We call these executable
logs "e-scripts". These "steps" are mainly of two kinds:

   1) elisp hyperlinks, and
   2) lines sent to shell-like programs.

To run the tutorial: install this package, then type `M-x
