= Ivy Explorer

Provides a large more easily readable grid for file browsing using
`ivy`.

By pressing `,` users can enter directories or open files on the
screen using `avy` (optional dependency, needs to be installed to use
this command). Pressing `;` will jump to the selected candidate and
invoke the dipsatch action dialog of `ivy`.
