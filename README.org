* Introduction

When collecting information using copy/paste, it would be useful if one could
stay in the application where things are copied instead of constantly switching
between Emacs and the other application to pase each item separately.

Further it would be great if Emacs could detect clipboard entries and adjust them
to the format one would like to save them.

This is what clipboard-collector is about. Here is an example for collecting
contact information from a website for org capture (contact info translated to
be used as property drawer items).



#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(clipboard-collector-create cc-capture-rss
 (("^http.*twitter.com"                           ":TWITTER: %s")
  ("^http.*reddit.com"                            ":REDDIT: %s")
  ("^http.*github.com"                            ":GITHUB: %s")
  ("^http.*youtube.com"                           ":YOUTUBE: %s")
  ("^http.*stack.*.com"                           ":STACK: %s")
  ("^https?://.*\\.[a-z]+/?\\'"                   ":DOMAIN: %s")
  ("^.*@.*"                                       ":MAIL: %s")
  ("^http.*\\(dotemacs\\|.?emacs\\|.?emacs.d\\)"  ":DOTEMACS: %s"))
 (lambda (items)
   (clipboard-collector-finish-default items)
   (org-capture-finalize)))
#+END_SRC
