* Introduction

When collecting information using copy/paste, it would be useful if one could
stay at one place to copy things instead of constantly switching between the
place where you copy and the place where you paste.

Further it would be great if Emacs could detect clipboard entries and adjust them
to the format one would like to have them.

This is what clipboard-collector is about. Here is an example for collecting
contact information from a website for org capture (contact info gets
transformed to be used as property drawer items).



#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(clipboard-collector-create cc-capture-rss
 (("^http.*twitter.com"                           ":TWITTER: %s")
  ("^http.*reddit.com"                            ":REDDIT: %s")
  ("^http.*github.com"                            ":GITHUB: %s")
  ("^http.*youtube.com"                           ":YOUTUBE: %s")
  ("^http.*stack.*.com"                           ":STACK: %s")
  ("^https?://.*\\.[a-z]+/?\\'"                   ":DOMAIN: %s")
  ("^.*@.*"                                       ":MAIL: %s")
  ("^http.*\\(dotemacs\\|.?emacs\\|.?emacs.d\\)"  ":DOTEMACS: %s"))
 (lambda (items)
   (clipboard-collector-finish-default items)
   (org-capture-finalize)))
#+END_SRC
