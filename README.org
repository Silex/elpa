* vdiff

A tool like vimdiff for Emacs 

** Introduction

vdiff is a diff tool for Emacs that is made to behave like vimdiff, meaning diff
information is displayed in buffers as you edit them. There are commands for
cycling through the changes detected by =diff= and applying changes from one
buffer to the other. The main features are

  1. Synchronized scrolling of the buffers with lines matching between the two
  2. Commands to transmit (send/receive) changes between buffers
  3. Automatic folding of lines that are unchanged in both buffers
  4. Commands to jump easily between changes
  5. Everything done through overlays, meaning vdiff doesn't alter the actual
     text in the buffer (unless you are transmit changes of course)

vdiff is still a work in progress, so use it at your own risk. Contributions and
suggestions are very welcome.

** Installation and Usage

It will be on MELPA eventually. For now, you have to clone this repository and
modify =load-path=. Here's an example =use-package= declaration.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package vdiff
  :load-path "path/to/vdiff"
  :commands (vdiff-buffers vdiff-files)
  :config
  (define-key vdiff-mode-map (kbd "C-c") vdiff-mode-prefix-map))
#+END_SRC

The last line puts the main vdiff commands under the =C-c= prefix. With this
declaration the key bindings in vdiff buffers are

| Key     | Command                         | Description                                        |
|---------+---------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| =C-c g= | =vdiff-goto-corresponding-line= | Jump to the corresponding line in the other buffer |
| =C-c n= | =vdiff-next-change=             | Move to next change in buffer                      |
| =C-c p= | =vdiff-previous-change=         | Move to previous change in buffer                  |
| =C-c r= | =vdiff-receive-changes=         | Receive the corresponding hunk from other buffer   |
| =C-c s= | =vdiff-send-changes=            | Send this hunk (or all in region) to other buffer  |
| =C-c c= | =vdiff-close-fold=              | Close fold at point or in region                   |
| =C-c C= | =vdiff-close-all-folds=         | Close all folds in buffer                          |
| =C-c o= | =vdiff-open-fold=               | Open fold at point or in region                    |
| =C-c O= | =vdiff-open-all-folds=          | Open all folds in buffer                           |
| =C-c w= | =vdiff-save-buffers=            | Save both buffers                                  |
| =C-c q= | =vdiff-quit=                    | Quit vdiff                                         |
| =C-l=   | =vdiff-sync-and-center=         | Recenter both buffers at current line              |

To start vdiff, use either =vdiff-files= to select two files or =vdiff-buffers=
to select two open buffers.

** Further customization
   
The current customization options and there defaults are
   
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Whether to lock scrolling by default when starting vdiff
  (setq vdiff-lock-scrolling t)

  ;; external diff program/command to use
  (setq vdiff-diff-program "diff")

  ;; Extra arguments to pass to diff. If this is set wrong, you may
  ;; break vdiff.
  (setq vdiff-diff-program-args "")

  ;; Commands that should be executed in other vdiff buffer to keep lines in
  ;; sync. There is no need to include commands that scroll the buffer here,
  ;; because those are handled differently.
  (setq vdiff-mirrored-commands '(next-line
                                  previous-line
                                  evil-next-line
                                  evil-previous-line
                                  beginning-of-buffer
                                  end-of-buffer))

  ;; Unchanged lines to leave unfolded around a fold
  (setq vdiff-fold-padding 2)

  ;; Minimum number of lines to fold
  (setq vdiff-min-fold-size 4)

  ;; Function that returns the string printed for a closed fold. The arguments
  ;; passed are the number of lines folded, the text on the first line, and the
  ;; width of the buffer.
  (setq vdiff-fold-string-function 'vdiff-fold-string-default)
