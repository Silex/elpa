* Emacs Bluetooth Mode

  This package provides a simple Bluetooth mode that can be used to manage
  Bluetooth devices on GNU/Linux using GNU Emacs.

  Implemented features are:
  - (un-)pairing devices
  - (dis-)connecting
  - discovery mode
  - setting device properties (alias, blocked, trusted)
  - setting adapter properties (powered, discoverable, pairable)
  - showing device information (alias, address, RSSI, class, services)
  - Imenu integration

  The implementation is based on the Bluez DBus interface (see
  [[https://www.bluez.org]]).

** Usage

   To use it, invoke ~M-x package-install-file~ on  ~bluetooth.el~
   and then  ~M-x list-bluetooth-devices~.  No configuration is
   necessary or possible.  Use ~M-x describe-mode~ (usually ~C-h m~) to get a list
   of key bindings.
