Thanks to the following people for helping me
get cpio-mode up and running.

Michael Albinus <michael.albinus@gmx.de>, for pointing out similar functions now available in TRAMP.
Sergey Poznyakoff <gray@gnu.org>, for consultation about the structure of cpio archives.
Sebastrian Kremer <sk@thp.uni-koeln.de> et al., for providing the dired code that has guided me on occasion and performed fontification for me outright.
