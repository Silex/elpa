BUGS (4.0):
- need to support HTTP/0.9 (http://c2.com:8080) responses
- When auto-loading the index.html file out of a directory, if the
  directory does not have the trailing '/', relative URL references
  are wrong.
- Make sure that we pass all the relative URL expansion tests at
  http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Efielding/url/test1.html
- /etc/mailcap cannot overide builtin mm-mime-data stuff?
- try to protect people from using '~' in file URLs
- keystrokes entered while in w3-pause self-insert under XEmacs - the
  loop around dispatch-event needs to be smarter about what it
  swallows.
- border-color can have multiple color specifications, but we
  currently choke with 'args out of range' when we see this.
- widget appears to be stealing button3 to mean 'activate' - this is
  bogus!  We lose all context-sensitive menus because of this.
- We still seem to be growing the line size under Emacs 19.x/20.x
- It would be really nice if w3 buffers were put into w3-mode as soon
  as they were created. Then if the rendering craps out somehow then
  the buffer could be browsed such as it was. Ideally, links and
  widgets would be functional.
- document how to translate Netscape foo.pac files to emacs lisp
- Should we stop using reporter.el?

BUGS (4.1):
- background colors are not heeded on table rows (<tr>).  Same
  properties on individual cells or the table as a whole work fine.
- <br> in <dd> hosed - margins in general tend to be too big sometimes.
- client side imagemaps have to be in the same buffer (actually in the
  smae buffer, _BEFORE_ the usemap directive on an image) - fix to be
  able to use imagemaps in different files, any position, etc, etc.

FEATURES (4.1)
- More tweaks to the hotindex stuff from Laurent Martelli <martelli@iie.cnam.fr>
    + Ask  to delete unresolved  entries.  Right now, keywords are
    associated to hotlist entries on the basis of entry names.  It
    means  that if you  rename  an  entry with a  hotindex-unaware
    W3/Emacs, hotindex will refuse  work. Same thing if you delete
    an entry. Of course, it would really be better to use the href
    instead of the entry name.

    +  Keywords weighting :  it  would be  nice to give  different
    weight to keywords  in  order to  precise the  relevance  of a
    keyword for a document. Query results woudl  then be sorted by
    relevance.

    +  Hotindex file  sharing  :  wouldn't it  be   nice  to share
    keywords files with your friends? Ideally,  one should be able
    to specify a list of keywords file to search in. Entries found
    in the first files would match  better than those found at the
    end. 

    + Automatically add  keywords found in  meta  tags and procide
    additional methods to automatically index documents.

    * Multi keyword search
- cache a formatted version of documents, with enough info to recreate
  the widgets in them.
- w3-preview-region command
- LDAP support (XEmacs)
- New proxy type for sending requests via mail to a mail->web->mail gateway.
- Emacspeak Interaction
  - some way of specifying in a stylesheet whether certain text is
    inaudible.  use the 'inaudible text property for this.
  - Full Aural-CSS support
- more sophisticated filling algorithm. I'm not sure exactly what
  would be sufficient but breaking lines after punctuation  seems like
  it would solve most of the problem.
- When fetching images for viewing (not inlining), W3 should at least
  have an option of displaying it inline, ala Netscape.
- Widget library merging
  - Write a font selection widget
  - Write a voice selection widget
  - Write a mailcap entry widget
- Custom library merging
  - Add custom support for MM
- Hotlist handling
  - Abstract out current support
  - Do something similar to GNUS 'backends' to provide easy way to add new
    bookmark formats, etc.
- Write a new major mode for handling CSS style sheets

FEATURES (5.0)
- Emacspeak Integration
  - Need option to turn off table rendering and print it out as a
    table that is viewable with emacspeak-table-ui.el
- Write a text/xml parser
- Completely rewrite display code again
  - Abstract everything out to follow parse->flow objects->render model
  - Base all stylesheet stuff off of DSSSL
  - CSS2
  - New rendering backends
    - Native postscript output
    - LaTeX upgrade
    - TeXinfo
- Display code
  - implement <spacer> from netscape 3.0b5
  - reimplement w3-show-headers
  - Handle math environment using the calc library
  - Better integration with the parser

MAINTENANCE CRAP (4.0)
- Get in touch with "Rob" == Rob Partington <rjp@netlink.co.uk> about
  registering w3.browser.org
- Legal Papers (status - emailed necessary paperwork)
  - Stephen Peters <speters@cygnus.com> - LaTeX code (???)
