;; List of packages that are maintained externally.
;; The list is made of elements of the form (NAME KIND URL).
;;
;; Where NAME is the name of the package;
;;
;; KIND can be one of:
;;  :subtree  = a "git subtree" in the `master' branch.
;;  :external = kept in a separate `externals/<name>' branch.
;;
;; And URL is the URL of the remote git repository that we want to track.
;; It can be nil, in which case we don't track anything (useless for
;; :subtree, but not for :external).
