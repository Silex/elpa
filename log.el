;;;; PURPOSE 
;;;;  
;;;; Logs state information about an editing session, including
;;;; keystrokes (with timestamps, command names, but no longer
;;;; arguments), file snapshots, process output, and temporary
;;;; buffers.  Provides some parsing functions for the data.
;;;;
;;;; USE
;;;; 
;;;; 1. Compile the C code for the timer process (search for "main") and
;;;; set *log-timer-program* to point to the object code.  (At CMU,
;;;; the value of *log-timer-program* below will do for sun3_mach and
;;;; pmax_mach.) 
;;;; [e.g., cc timer.c -o timer.sun4]
;;;; 
;;;; 2. Put something appropriate in ./emergency.el (see
;;;; "log-load-emergency-file"). 
;;;; 
;;;; 3. Byte-compile ("M-x byte-compile log.el"). 
;;;; 
;;;; 4. Load ("M-x load-library log"). 
;;;; 
;;;; 5. Start logging ("M-x log-initialize"). 
;;;;
;;;;    State is written in "Log.<type>.timestamp", where <type> is
;;;;    "keys" (keystrokes), "temp-buffers" (an accumulation of temp 
;;;;    buffer contents), or a process name.  Change directory where 
;;;;    state files are written with M-x log-data-directory. 
;;;;
;;;;    A separate backup is made for a file every time it's saved,
;;;;    in the file's directory.  
;;;; 
;;;;    State files and backups are compressed (end in ".Z"). 
;;;; 
;;;; 6. Stop logging (exit emacs) or turn off logging with log-quit.
;;;; 
;;;; 7. Uncompress and visit a keystroke log file, then run
;;;; "log-time-episodes" on the buffer, and "log-spread-out" on the
;;;; output of that.  Then try "log-collapse" to collapse and count
;;;; series of the same character.
;;;;
;;;; 
;;;; THE KEYSTROKE LOG
;;;; 
;;;; Keystrokes accumulate in the buffer " *log*", one entry per line,
;;;; until there are lots of them, when they're written to a file and
;;;; compressed.  To make one big log with line numbers, "uncompress
;;;; Log.keys.*; cat -n Log.keys* > keystroke-log.txt".  (You might
;;;; first want to cut out the first few lines of the first log file,
;;;; which identify the system and user.)
;;;; 
;;;; Command arguments appear at the "effects column", at the right
;;;; end of each line.  Buffer switches log the destination buffer,
;;;; cursor line, and the window's location over the buffer.  Yanks
;;;; and kills log their contents, indented to effects column.

;;;; Uses after-command-hook.
;;;; 
;;;; Loads either before or after other packages, and loads safely on
;;;; top of itself. 
;;;; 
;;;; If it wedges anyway, there's a back door
;;;; (log-load-emergency-file, bound always to C-x4l).
;;;; 
;;;; Uses kill-emacs-hook and temp-buffer-show-hook, but tries to be
;;;; smart about existing hooks (see log-reset-hook). 
;;;; 
;;;; The timer process sucks a little, but emacs doesn't have a fine-
;;;; grain timer.  A sun3_mach is too slow for this package to keep up
;;;; with this typist (who's of medium skill).  A pmax_mach is ok. 
;;;; Sometimes events appear to happen at the same time. 
;;;;
;;;; Doesn't deal with mouse events. 
;;;; 
;;;; The original "read-char" bypasses keymaps.  It's redefined here,
;;;; but it having a byte code means that compiled functions won't see
;;;; the new definition.  So far reloads only isearch.el. 
;;;;

;;;; History:

;;;; 12-2-94 - modified to work in 19, sorta.  Not as clean or commented, 
;;;;   but not bad.  Useful for undergraduate practicals.
;;;;
;;;; 1-14-94 - smarter mouse behavior.  x-flush-mouse-queue was it,
;;;;   getting called on both up and down clicks.  now this and
;;;;   x-mouse-ignore aren't logged, and other mouse functions are,
;;;;   along with their args.  seems mouse functions aren't
;;;;   interactive, and get args directly when they're dispatched, so
;;;;   changed log-call to deal with args when they're there.
;;;;
;;;; 12-23-93 - timestamps (in log-time-episodes) were overflowing;
;;;;   changed from 100s of a second to 10s.
;;;;
;;;; 12-22-93 - display-time is a process whose buffer is whatever
;;;;   buffer you're in.  this confused the code in log-initialize
;;;;   that set buffer-file-names for existing process buffers,
;;;;   causing it to change the name of a text buffer.  fixed that and
;;;;   some other contingencies.  
;;;;   
;;;; 12-20-93 - "(accept-process-output log-timer-process 1)"; "1" was
;;;;    wrong; how'd it get there?
;;;;
;;;; 11-9-93 - log-time-episodes and log-spread-out now take bigger
;;;;   timestamps (5+3 digits).  episode brackets are 5+1, the 5
;;;;   because a very long interval (two emacs, in different windows)
;;;;   would cause aliasing, the 1 because that's all that's useful in
;;;;   spread-out format.  floats now represented internally as
;;;;   hundredth-second ints.
;;;; 
;;;; 10-13-93 - key logs written with require-final-newline t.
;;;; 
;;;; 10-4-93 - popper was redefining pop-to-buffer, causing a binding
;;;;   loop; log-new-load now resets most functions before calling
;;;;   load, then restores the redefinitions.  removed "list*" (see
;;;;   below).  log.el loads into a bare editor, and my .emacs (which
;;;;   loads popper) loads after.  compress snapshots.
;;;;
;;;;     note: log.el breaks substitute-command-keys (because keys are all
;;;;     lambdas), which has a byte-code.
;;;;
;;;; 10-3-93 - set hooks better; tried to set temp-buffer-show-hook.
;;;;   replaced dolist; can't figure out where to get it, or where i
;;;;   get backquote.
;;;; 
;;;; 10-2-93 - keystroke files get compressed when written.  filenames
;;;;   are better.  wrote some code and fixed some bugs from within an
;;;;   editor that was logging.
;;;; 
;;;; 10-1-93 - now filters output of timer, and blocks on read to
;;;;   synchronize; maybe this will prevent any future instances of
;;;;   things being written in the log out ofkilter, and we can now
;;;;   get the timestamp by itself.  process buffers and filters now
;;;;   log process output.  
;;;; 
;;;; 9-28-93 - logs chars deleted, forwards or backwards, and screen
;;;;   info for scrolls and buffer leaps (#6 and #7, in updated list);
;;;;   quietly visits a timestamped file for each new or existing
;;;;   process buffer, quietly writing it when buffers are killed or
;;;;   saved (#2); prints characters entered to isearch (but won't
;;;;   get other read-char args unless the .el files for the functions
;;;;   are reloaded).
;;;;
;;;; 9-27-93 - priorities:
;;;;      X1. preimages - copy the original; does "~" do it?
;;;;         no: user may start in the middle of a session
;;;;      X2. save process buffers
;;;;      3. accumulate output of temp buffers
;;;;      4. isearch - record arguments
;;;;      X5. checkpoints a diff at every save
;;;;         . wrap auto-save to record a timestamp with the file
;;;;         attribute representing time that i see with an ls; set
;;;;         delete-auto-save-files (215) to nil
;;;;         . change save-buffer to call backup-buffer every save
;;;;         . change backup-buffer to timestamp filenames
;;;;         . set make-backup-files t
;;;;         . version-control (variable)
;;;;         . save-some-buffers in log-initialize, if that helps
;;;;      X6. scrolls put out line and column numbers
;;;;         . scroll-up, scroll-down, scroll-other-window all separate, C
;;;;      X7. deletes put out characters
;;;;      ?8. ^N, ^P put out line numbers [too slow?  'sides, have scrolls]
;;;;
;;;;      todo:
;;;;        copy all visited buffers on exit (?)
;;;;      emacs things to look at:
;;;;         checkpointing - "~" (#1)
;;;;         associating process buffers with file and auto-saving (#2)
;;;;         with-output-to-temp-buffer (#3)
;;;;         redefining read-char (#4)
;;;;         redefining isearch (#5)
;;;;
;;;;         append-to-file
;;;;         copy-file
;;;;         kept-old/new-versions (213)
;;;;     [initial version:]
;;;;      1. preimages - copy the original; does "~" do it?
;;;;         no: user may start in the middle of a session
;;;;      2. save process buffers
;;;;      3. accumulate output of temp buffers
;;;;      4. isearch - record arguments
;;;;      5. checkpoints a diff at every save
;;;;         . wrap auto-save to record a timestamp with the file
;;;;         attribute representing time that i see with an ls; set
;;;;         delete-auto-save-files (215) to nil
;;;;         . change save-buffer to call backup-buffer every save
;;;;         . change backup-buffer to timestamp filenames
;;;;         . set make-backup-files t
;;;;         . version-control (variable)
;;;;         . save-some-buffers in log-initialize, if that helps
;;;;
;;;;   did 1 and 5, by redefining save-buffer and
;;;;   find-backup-file-name.  log now points to backups, up to a
;;;;   hundred of which are made, every save.  saves all buffers on
;;;;   initialization after redefinition, to get preimages of buffers
;;;;   modified but not written at log-initialization.
;;;;   
;;;;   the preimage is the set of first backups for each file after
;;;;   log-initialization.
;;;; 
;;;; 9-26-93 - wrap find-file (and write-file?) to squirrel away the
;;;;   pre-image; also for reading files; and get snapshots when files
;;;;   are written!  what if source files are huge, changes small, and
;;;;   writes frequent?  store diffs, like RCS?
;;;; 
;;;; 6-26-93 - Fixed up the keymap-walking functions to send warnings
;;;;   to a buffer instead of generating an error.  Also added fix
;;;;   that FER's sent me on 14 May.
;;;;
;;;;   Here's something odd (see ~/data/s10*/keystroke*/originals/).
;;;;   I suppose some buffer somewhere got clobbered, but it's beyond me.

;;;; 6-20-93 - Began adding functions to parse the logs; may never get
;;;;   beyond log-parse-1.
;;;;
;;;; 3-30-93 - added log-load-emergency-file and C-x4l binding, after
;;;;   losing gary's shell binding when the keybindings wedged.
;;;;   tim freeman pointed out that a back door would have been
;;;;   useful.  added test in log-keystroke ("3-30-93") that fixed the
;;;;   problem when exit-emacs queried about killing remaining
;;;;   processes; didn't seem to slow things down. 
;;;; 
;;;; 3-5-93 - ways to segment the log:
;;;;   . version-control, on the file visited by the log buffer.  but
;;;;   version-control isn't buffer-local, so it will be on for all
;;;;   files being edited.
;;;;   . do my own version-control; write the file, rename it to
;;;;   something that includes the version-control counter.  but that
;;;;   entails visiting a file, which means that one can't use the
;;;;   nice buffer name that begins with a leading blank.
;;;;
;;;; . Command arguments seem to reach the process buffer before the
;;;; output process, even though the commands that generate them are
;;;; called after the process is sent its string.  And
;;;; accept-process-output after the process-send-string didn't help.
;;;; And when using the debugger to trace calls to log-call (first)
;;;; and log-keystroke (second), the arguments and process output
;;;; reach the process buffer in the right order.  Some race
;;;; condition?
;;;; 
;;;;   [ 11-18-92 - fixed by moving the process marker just before
;;;;   sending the new process string (in log-keystroke) rather than
;;;;   just after inserting command output in the process buffer
;;;;   (log-comman*).  execution order is now (1) log keystroke; (2)
;;;;   command output; (3) process output from #1 arrives at process
;;;;   mark, before command output (4) (next keystroke) process mark
;;;;   moved past command output.  #4 was happening after #2, meaning
;;;;   that #3 was appearing after the command output ]
;;;;
;;;; . Loses the logging of command arguments if packages loaded on
;;;; top of this re-defun the commands.  Popper.el is irresponsible in
;;;; this regard (it should define new functions that call the old
;;;; symbol-function, rather than clobber it with a defun).
;;;;
;;;;   [ 11-22-92 - keep track of all redefined functions, then
;;;;   redefine load to map log-redefine across the list.  made
;;;;   log-redefine "reentrant". ]
;;;;
;;;; 11-28-92 - indenting copy-as-kills is meant to improve
;;;;   filterability.  in particular, it means that keystrokes can be
;;;;   counted by filtering out lines that lead with spaces.
;;;;   important if one happens to yank mulitple lines from the log
;;;;   buffer...
