Excorporate Manual
******************

Excorporate provides Exchange Web Services (EWS) support for Emacs.

   If the Exchange server you access is configured to provide EWS
support, then there's a 76% chance that Excorporate will enable you to
retrieve your calendar entries from the comfort of Emacs.

   The 24% failure rate is because accessing - in particular,
authenticating against - an Exchange server can be challenging.

   Known to fail are Kerberos/GSSAPI authentication and accessing the
server through a proxy
(<https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=10>).

   Patches are welcome to enable more of these access scenarios.

1 Installation
**************

Excorporate works on Emacs versions >= 24.1.

Install 'excorporate' from the GNU ELPA repository:

   'M-x package-install RET excorporate'


File: excorporate.info,  Node: Configuration,  Next: Usage,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Top

2 Configuration
***************

Ideally you won't need to configure Excorporate at all.  On friendly
Exchange setups, Excorporate can discover the EWS URL automatically.

First try:

   'M-x excorporate'

which will prompt you for the Exchange account email address.  Follow
the prompts and if all goes well, you'll see a message in the minibuffer
or in *Messages* saying that the connection is ready.

   If autodiscovery runs out of URLs to try, then customize
'excorporate-configuration':

   'M-x customize-variable RET excorporate-configuration'

   From the value menu select "Skip autodiscovery".  This allows you to
enter the Exchange account email address and the EWS URL directly.  The
EWS URL is of the form 'https://mail.gnu.org/ews/exchange.asmx'.

   After saving the configuration, try 'M-x excorporate' again.

   If that doesn't work, then you're probably out of luck, or you'll
have to start a troubleshooting deep dive (*note Troubleshooting::).

3 Usage
*******

Excorporate binds 'e' in '*Calendar*' buffers.  Open the calendar with:

   'M-x calendar'

move the cursor to the date you want to see meetings for, and press 'e'.
This will show the meetings in a temporary read-only Org Mode buffer
named '*Excorporate*'.

4 Troubleshooting
*****************

First, you'll want to double-check that the Exchange server you're
trying to access provides EWS support.  If it doesn't, Excorporate can't
do anything for you.  Before asking your Exchange administrator, check
intranet wikis and so forth; other users of non-standard clients may
have already found the EWS URL.

   The buffer '*fsm-debug*' shows 'excorporate' state transitions and
should provide details of where things went wrong.

   Also check '*Messages*' for anything obvious.

   If you suspect something wrong with accessing the EWS URL, try
setting 'url-debug' to t and retry 'M-x excorporate', then check the
'*URL-DEBUG*' buffer for output.

   If you suspect NTLM authentication is failing, as a long shot, you
might try setting 'ntlm-compatibility-level' to 0 and retrying 'M-x
excorporate'.

   Excorporate's dependencies implement the tricky elements of
asynchronous Exchange access: a state machine ('fsm'), TLS negotiation
('gnutls'), NTLM authentication ('ntlm' and 'url-http-ntlm') and SOAP
communication ('soap-client').
