A package for working with GNU Global source tagging system inside
Emacs.

Usage:
Type `M-x ggtags-mode' to enable the minor mode, or as usual enable it
in your desired major mode hooks. When the mode is on, the symbol at
point is underlined if it is a valid tag.

`M-.' finds definitions/declarations and `C-u M-.' finds references.

If multiple matches are found, navigation mode is enabled. In this
mode, `M-n' and `M-p' moves to next and previous match, and M-} and
M-{ to next and previous file, respectively. `M-o' toggles between
full and abbreviated displays of file names in the auxiliary popup
window. When you have found the right match, press RET to finish,
which can be resumed with `C-c M-n'. `M-*' aborts the search.

Normally after a few searches a dozen buffers are created visiting
files tracked by GNU Global. `C-c M-k' helps clean them up.
