#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil

* Nameless --- /less is more/
*Hide package namespaces in your emacs-lisp code.*

Simply put, turn on this minor mode, and you’ll see this
[[file:example-nameless-on.png]]\\
instead of this
[[file:example-nameless-off.png]]

** Usage

To use this package add the following configuration to your Emacs init file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'nameless-mode)
#+END_SRC

You can configure a string to use instead of ~:~ by setting the
~nameless-prefix~, and the name of the face used is ~nameless-face~.
You can even just hide the prefix completely by setting this variable
to an empty string.

While the mode is active, the =_= key inserts the package namespace if
appropriate.

* Configuration

Nameless can also be used to “import” other packages as aliases. For
instance, in the default behaviour, functions in the ~font-lock~
package (e.g., ~font-lock-add-keywords~) will be displayed with the
~fl:~ prefix (e.g., ~fl:add-keywords~).

You can configure your own aliases globally with
~nameless-global-aliases~, and on a file-local basis with
~nameless-aliases~.
