## Swiper

Package for GNU Emacs that gives you an overview as you search for a regex

The package uses the `ivy` back end for the overview, see also
[swiper-helm](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper-helm).

## Screenshots

There's also a ten minute [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnJQpTFVDc).

## Issues

Recently, the `ivy` package that provided `ivy.el` was removed from MELPA.  Now, the `swiper` package provides `ivy.el`. You should remove the outdated `ivy` package from your system.
