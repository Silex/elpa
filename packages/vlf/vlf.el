;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the M-x vlf command, which visits part of a
;; large file in a read-only buffer without visiting the entire file.
;; The buffer uses VLF mode, which defines the commands M-<next>
;; (vlf-next-batch) and M-<prior> (vlf-prev-batch) to visit other
;; parts of the file.  The option `vlf-batch-size' specifies the size
;; of each batch, in bytes.

;; This package was inspired by a snippet posted by Kevin Rodgers,
;; showing how to use `insert-file-contents' to extract part of a
;; file.

;;; Code:
